An ork and human child play catch with a moldy loaf of bread while a cohort of small, malnourished elven youths desperately try to intercept for a morsel. They are older in years, but much weaker and any who come close are viciously kicked away to the jeers of onlookers. Eventually a throw is bad and the bread is swarmed by the elven youths fighting amongst themselves like rabid dogs. An orcish guards wades in, viciously striking at the youths and barking orders. He retrieves the moldy bread and quietens the youths, before spitting at them, stomping on the bread and hurling it back to the ork and human child; to continue their game of catch.
