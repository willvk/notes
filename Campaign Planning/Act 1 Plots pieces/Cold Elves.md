A band of explorers venturing into lands uncharted stumble upon a vast tower rising from the forest. It is beautiful and weaves around the trees as if it grew itself among them. It is undoubtedly elven so you turn to the half-elven member of your group to treat on your behalf. She approaches the walls and offers all that you can spare so that you may rest and gain some respite from the dangers of the forest. The elves mock her and refuse, "the stench of you and yours would stain ourselves so, even our dearest would refuse our company hereafter" they hissed. Suddenly a shriek explodes from the nearby forest and smashes one of your company against the elven walls of the tower, crushing him and showering you all in his remains. You have barely time to react as you look pleadingly at those beautiful elven faces, as they close and bar the tower entrance.
