I actually was thinking that The Guild had bribed one of the Fingers into taking over Loki's Hand.  Brelka thinks that Kvarrac is weak and gone soft in his old age. She sees him smuggling food in for the elves and refusing to strike against the fat cats in upper hammerfall like they used to. Kvarrac is trying to stay under the radar and build up allies by providing food to people in the Shallows who are starving. Smuggling supplies in and selling it on the cheap through specific distributors. Brelka is a betrayer but her quickness to anger is caused by the lycanthropy (rat) which she contracted on a smuggling job. She has quietly spread it around people she can trust and is creating a group to seize control of Loki's Hand and kill Kvarrac. Then she will go to war on Upper Hammerfall using any methods and tactics. All of this is driven by the disease making her angry and driving her to violence.
