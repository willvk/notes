Orkish raiders embark on a voyages across the wriggling seas to settle the Wilds. Cheers and shouts of joy see them off, among prayers to Odin and a fresh sacrifice of the village's most healthy goat. As the boat passes from the shallows into the depths of the wriggling sea it is quickly devoured by one of Jormungandr's children, screams echo back to shore as family members turn from the gruesome sight.
