Humans have become flocking to Hammerfall, as months pass more hungry mouths appear at your doorstep. Normal food production and housing are starting to be exhausted especially with certain key factions taking the lion share. If only you could unlock some of the secrets of the arcane artifacts left behind by the elves, surely they could help provide food, but that would require harbouring the elves and would that do more harm than good?

These Chosen as they call themselves never did reveal how they secured passages to Upper Hammerfall. There is something not right with them you are sure. Too many people go missing while treating with them. Odin would not smile upon treating with a folk who you know so little about.

The disappearance of the high elves just before the fall of Hammerfall was a mystery to all including the elves left guarding the walls. Strange magical defenses failed and the city was quickly overrun. Did the gods simply favour them or where did the elven nobility, the ruling class go? Will they return one day to reclaim their lost city?

The tension between the orcs and the humans is a constant problem. Warrior elites from both peoples clash politcally and physically. Blood has not been spilled as yet, but it is only a matter of time unless a common ground can be found.

Someone is breaching the restrictions on the elves. You have noticed that their complaints have lessened of late. This is a breach of the terms of the Pact.
